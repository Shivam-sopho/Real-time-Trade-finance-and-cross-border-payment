# Trade Finance and Cross Border Payments in Real Time using Hyperledger Fabric

## Trade Finance 
The function of trade finance is to introduce a third-party to transactions to remove the payment risk and the supply risk. Trade finance provides the exporter with receivables or payment according to the agreement while the importer might be extended credit to fulfill the trade order.

## Issues with Trade Finance
Trade financing, where financial institutions provide credit facilities in order to guarantee exchange of goods, is a centuries old industry that hasnâ€™t seen much change with the growth of global trade flows. There are flowing pain-points & inefficienes in the current system - 
1. Manual contract creation - The import bank manually reviews the financial agreement provided by the importer and sends financials to the correspondent bank
2. Invoice factoring - Exporters use invoices to achieve short-term financing from multiple banks, adding additional risk in the event the delivery of goods fails
3. Delayed timeline - The shipment of goods is delayed due to multiple checks by intermediaries and numerous communication points
4. Manual AML review -The export bank must manually conduct AML checks using the financials provided by the import bank
5. Multiple versions of the truth: As financials are sent from one entity to another, significant version control challenges exist as changes are made
6. Duplicative bills of lading: Bills of lading are financed multiple times due to the inability of banks to verify their authenticity
7. Multiple platforms: Since each party across countries operates on different platforms, miscommunication is common and the propensity for fraud is high

## Cross Border Payments
Remittance is a fund-transfer transaction wherein are moved from one account to another account within the same or different financial institution. In a cross-border payment, SWIFT handles only the movement of messages along with payment chain. The correspondent banks do the actual debits and credits across accounts based on the message and helps pass on the vlaue to the final beneficiary.

## Issues/Drawbacks with Cross Border Payment Process
1. Since no two banks can agree on the transaction based on their own ledger, SWIFT came into being to guarantee and confirm message transmission. Central banks operated as settlement agents to guarantee payments.
2. SWIFT charges the bank for processing orders irrespective of whether the bank is at the both the receiving and sending end of instruction
3. A single cross-border payment has to traverse through certain correspondent banks which are involved in activited like receiving, collating, and netting payment meesages before retransmitting confirmations. This increases the time to settle. 

## Benefits of using Blockchain 
1. It leads to exclusion of any middlemen, central agencies, or correspondents from payment processing. 
2. Reduced cost with minimal charges along with the payment chain.
3. Reduced turnaround time for settlement as there is no need for central agencies and movement of messages.
